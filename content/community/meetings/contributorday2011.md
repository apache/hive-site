# Apache Hive : ContributorDay2011

[Apache Hive Contributor Day](http://hivecontribday2011.eventbrite.com) is a special event hosted as part of Yahoo's Hadoop Summit.

Resources for mini-hackathon:

* [PluginDeveloperKit]({{< ref "plugindeveloperkit" >}}) has info on the new pdk; download [this snapshot build](http://people.apache.org/~jvs/hive-0.8.0-pdk-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz) of Hive which includes it
* you'll need a Mac or Linux development environment with Hive+Hadoop already installed on it per [these instructions]({{< ref "gettingstarted-latest" >}}); for Hive, use the snapshot
* you'll also need [Apache ant](http://ant.apache.org) installed.
* [HIVE-1545](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1545) has the UDF libraries we'd like to get cleaned up for inclusion in Hive or extension libraries (download core.tar.gz and/or ext.tar.gz)
