This page collects some resources and pointers for various efforts underway to add security features to Hive and related projects.

Authorization modes

The links below refer to the [original Hive authorization mode]({{< ref "45876173" >}}). See [Authorization]({{< ref "languagemanual-authorization_27362032" >}}) for an overview of authorization modes, which include [storage based authorization]({{< ref "storage-based-authorization-in-the-metastore-server_45876440" >}}) and [SQL standards based authorization]({{< ref "sql-standard-based-hive-authorization_40509928" >}}).
