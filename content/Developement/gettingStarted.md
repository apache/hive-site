The Apache Hive &trade; data warehouse software facilitates reading,

A command line tool and JDBC driver are provided to connect users to
Hive.

# Getting Involved With The Apache Hive Community

Apache Hive is an open source project run by volunteers at the Apache
Software Foundation. Previously it was a subproject of [Apache&reg;
Hadoop&reg;][APACHE_HADOOP], but has now graduated to become a
top-level project of its own. We encourage you to learn about the
project and contribute your expertise.
