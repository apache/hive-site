# Apache Hive : Compaction pooling

### Concept:

Compaction requests and workers can be assigned to pools. A worker assigned to a specific pool will only process compaction requests in that pool. Workers and compaction requests without pool assignment are implicitly belong to the *default pool.* The pooling concept allows fine tuning of processing compaction requests. For example it is possible to create a pool name 'high priority compaction', assign some frequently modified tables to it, and dedicate a set of workers to this pool. As a result, the compaction requests for these tables will be immediately picked up by the dedicated workers, even if there are several other compaction requests (enqueued earlier) in the default queue.

### Pool assignment

Compaction requests can be assigned to pools in three different ways.

#### Automatic pool assignment

Databases, tables and partitions can be assigned to compaction pools through the

```
hive.compactor.worker.pool={pool_name}
```

[Database/Table property](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions#HiveTransactions-TableProperties). If the property is set on Database level, it applies to all tables and partitions. The pool also can be assigned on a table/partition level, in this case it overrides the Database level value (if set).   
If any of the above is set, it is used by the *Initiator* during the creation of the compaction requests.

#### Manual pool assignment

The compaction request also can be assigned to a pool by using the ALTER TABLE COMPACT command (E.g. manual compaction). If provided, this value overrides the *hive.compactor.worker.pool* value on any level.

```
ALTER TABLE COMPACT table_name POOL 'pool_name';
```

#### Implicit pool assignment

Tables, partitions and manual compaction requests without specified pool name are implicitly assigned to the default pool.

### Pool timeout

If a compaction request is not processed by any of the labeled pools within a predefined period, it falls back to the default pool. The timeout can be set through the 

```
hive.compactor.worker.pool.timeout
```

configuration property.  This approach is to cover the following use cases:

* The request is accidentally assigned to a non-existent pool. (E.g.: Typo in the pool name when issuing an ALTER TABLE COMPACT command.
* Typo in the DB or table property used by the initiator to create compaction requests.
* A HS2 instance is stopped due to a scaledown or schedule, and its pending compaction requests still should be processed.

The timeout can be disabled by setting the configuration property to 0.

### Labeled worker pools

The labeled worker pools can be defined through the 

```
hive.compactor.worker.{poolname}.threads={thread_count} 
```

configuration setting. Please note that in this case the configuration key is also dynamic.

### Default pool

The default pool is responsible for processing the non-labeled and timed-out compaction requests. On a cluster-wide level, at least 1 worker thread on at least one node should be assigned to the default pool, otherwise compaction requests may never be processed.

### Worker allocation

The already existing *hive.compactor.worker.threads* configuration value holds the maximum number of worker threads. The worker allocation happens as follows:

* Labeled pools are initialized in a sequential manner with random ordering.
* Each pool decreases the number of available workers by its own worker count.
* If the number of assignable workers is less than the configured one, the pool size will be adjusted (In other words: if the requested pool size is 5 but there are only 3 workers remaining, than the pool size will be decreased to 3).
* If the number of assignable workers is 0, the pool won’t be initialized.
* All remaining workers not used up by the labeled pools, are assigned to the default pool.

The worker allocation can be configured per HS2 instance.
