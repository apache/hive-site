# Apache Hive : Performance






## YourKit Java Profiler Collaboration

To measure Hive's internal performance, we use the [YourKit Java Profiler](http://www.yourkit.com). YourKit LLC is kindly supporting open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler. 

The Hive project has been granted YourKit open source licenses to be used by its developers. For more information on this collaboration, ask on the [developers mailing list](http://hadoop.apache.org/hive/mailing_lists.html#Developers).

 

## Benchmarks

Here are some JIRA issues about benchmarks for Hive:

* [Hive performance benchmarks](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-396) (HIVE-396)
* [Running TPC-H queries on Hive](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-600) (HIVE-600)
