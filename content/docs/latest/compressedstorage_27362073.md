# Apache Hive : CompressedStorage

## Compressed Data Storage

Keeping data compressed in Hive tables has, in some cases, been known to give better performance than uncompressed storage; both in terms of disk usage and query performance.

You can import text files compressed with Gzip or Bzip2 directly into a table stored as TextFile. The compression will be detected automatically and the file will be decompressed on-the-fly during query execution. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE raw (line STRING)
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/tmp/weblogs/20090603-access.log.gz' INTO TABLE raw;

```

The table 'raw' is stored as a TextFile, which is the default storage. However, in this case Hadoop will not be able to split your file into chunks/blocks and run multiple maps in parallel. This can cause underutilization of your cluster's 'mapping' power.

The recommended practice is to insert data into another table, which is stored as a SequenceFile. A SequenceFile can be split by Hadoop and distributed across map jobs whereas a GZIP file cannot be. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE raw (line STRING)
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

CREATE TABLE raw_sequence (line STRING)
   STORED AS SEQUENCEFILE;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/tmp/weblogs/20090603-access.log.gz' INTO TABLE raw;

SET hive.exec.compress.output=true;
SET io.seqfile.compression.type=BLOCK; -- NONE/RECORD/BLOCK (see below)
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE raw_sequence SELECT * FROM raw;

```

The value for io.seqfile.compression.type determines how the compression is performed. Record compresses each value individually while BLOCK buffers up 1MB (default) before doing compression.

### LZO Compression
