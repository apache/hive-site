# Rules for inclusion into branch-1.2 targeting 1.2.2

  

Now that 1.2.1 has been released, branch-1.2 now tracks an eventual 1.2.2 release. To commit any patch to branch-1.2 now, the following rules apply:

 

1. The commit must not introduce any schema or interface changes.
2. The commit must fix a bug that causes an outage/breakage (such as an NPE) in regular hive operation, or it must fix a data corruption issue or it must be a security fix with an appropriate CVE.

 

All commits that do not meet these criteria should be directed towards branch-1 (for an eventual 1.3 release). The goal of an eventual 1.2.2 update to branch-1.2 is merely to ensure that there is a stable maintenance line to use, and should not be used to simply add additional features to previously released lines.

# List of JIRAS deferred out of 1.2

The following are jiras originally intended for branch-1.2, but at this time, should not be committed to branch-1.2, and should only go to master(1.3). These jiras were moved out of the above backlog list into this after a discussion between the RM and the committer asking for inclusion.
