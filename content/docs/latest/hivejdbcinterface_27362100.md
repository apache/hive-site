# Apache Hive : HiveJDBCInterface

# Hive JDBC Driver

* [Hive JDBC Driver]({{< ref "#hive-jdbc-driver" >}})
	+ [Integration with Pentaho]({{< ref "#integration-with-pentaho" >}})
	+ [Integration with SQuirrel SQL Client]({{< ref "#integration-with-squirrel-sql-client" >}})

The current JDBC interface for Hive only supports running queries and fetching results. Only a small subset of the metadata calls are supported.

To see how the JDBC interface can be used, see [sample code]({{< ref "hiveclient_27362101" >}}).

### Integration with Pentaho

1. Download pentaho report designer from the [pentaho website](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140317&package_id=192362).
2. Overwrite report-designer.sh with the code provided below.

```
#!/bin/sh

HADOOP_CORE={{ls $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-*-core.jar}}
CLASSPATH=.:$HADOOP_CORE:$HIVE_HOME/conf

for i in ${HIVE_HOME}/lib/*.jar ; do
  CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$i
done

CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:launcher.jar

echo java -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -cp $CLASSPATH -jar launcher.jar
java -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -cp $CLASSPATH org.pentaho.commons.launcher.Launcher

```
3. Build and start the hive server with instructions from [HiveServer]({{< ref "hiveserver_27362111" >}}).
4. Compile and run the Hive JDBC client code to load some data (I haven't figured out how to do this in report designer yet). See [sample code]({{< ref "hiveclient_27362101" >}}) for loading the data.
5. Run the report designer (note step 2).

```
$ sh reporter-designer.sh

```
6. Select 'Report Design Wizard'.
7. Select a template - say 'fall template' - next.
8. Create a new data source - JDBC (custom), Generic database.
9. Provide Hive JDBC parameters. Give the connection a name 'hive'.

```
   URL: jdbc:hive://localhost:10000/default
   Driver name: org.apache.hadoop.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver
   Username and password are empty

```
10. Click on 'Test'. The test should succeed.
11. Edit the query: select 'Sample Query', click edit query, click on the connection 'hive'. Create a new query. Write a query on the table testHiveDriverTable, for example, select * from testHiveDriverTable. Click next.
12. Layout Step: Add `PageOfPages` to Group Items By. Add key and value as Selected Items. Click next. And Finish.
13. Change the Report header to 'hive-pentaho-report'. Change the type of the header to 'html'.
14. Run the report and generate pdf. You should get something like the report attached here.

### Integration with SQuirrel SQL Client

1. Download, install and start the SQuirrel SQL Client from the [SQuirrel SQL website](http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/).
2. Select 'Drivers -> New Driver...' to register the Hive JDBC driver.
	1. Enter the driver name and example URL:
	
	
	
	```
	   Name: Hive
	   Example URL: jdbc:hive://localhost:10000/default
	
	```
3. Select 'Extra Class Path -> Add' to add the following jars from your local Hive and Hadoop distribution.

```
   HIVE_HOME/build/dist/lib/*.jar
   HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-*-core.jar
```
4. Select 'List Drivers'. This will cause SQuirrel to parse your jars for JDBC drivers and might take a few seconds. From the 'Class Name' input box select the Hive driver:

```
   org.apache.hadoop.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver
```
5. Click 'OK' to complete the driver registration.
6. Select 'Aliases -> Add Alias...' to create a connection alias to your Hive server.
	1. Give the connection alias a name in the 'Name' input box.
	2. Select the Hive driver from the 'Driver' drop-down.
	3. Modify the example URL as needed to point to your Hive server.
	4. Leave 'User Name' and 'Password' blank and click 'OK' to save the connection alias.
7. To connect to the Hive server, double-click the Hive alias and click 'Connect'.

When the connection is established you will see errors in the log console and might get a warning that the driver is not JDBC 3.0 compatible. These alerts are due to yet-to-be-implemented parts of the JDBC metadata API and can safely be ignored. To test the connection enter *SHOW TABLES* in the console and click the run icon.

Also note that when a query is running, support for the 'Cancel' button is not yet available.
