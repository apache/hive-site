# Apache Hive : Unit Test Parallel Execution

It's likely you are looking for [Hive PreCommit Patch Testing]({{< ref "hive-precommit-patch-testing_33295252" >}}).

This page explains how to use parallel testing in Hive (<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1487>).

## Installation

### Python modules

To use parallel tests you have to install Python with "argparse" and "mako"  
 modules. You can do that using your package manager or you can install the  
 modules by hand. If you're using Python 2.7 or newer, "argparse" module is  
 already included and you don't have to install it.

#### Global installation

You can install the modules globally for all users with "easy_install":

```
sudo easy_install argparse
sudo easy_install mako

```

#### Local installation

If you don't have root acces on the machine, or you don't want to pollute your  
 system directories, you can install the modules in your home directory.

```
easy_install --prefix "~/.python_modules" argparse
easy_install --prefix "~/.python_modules" mako

```

You'll have to update "PYTHONPATH" environmental variable to include  
 "~/.python_modules". You can do that by adding this line to your ".bashrc" or  
 ".zshrc":

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${HOME}/.python_modules/lib/pythonVERSION/site-packages"

```

Where "VERSION" is Python version you're using, like "2.6" or "2.7", for example  
 if you're using Python 2.6:

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${HOME}/.python_modules/lib/python2.6/site-packages"

```

### SSH keys

You will have to setup SSH so you can access all test nodes without a password.

### Configuration

#### Configuration file

You'll need to configure which hosts the test should run on. You should put  
 your configuration file in "~/.hive_ptest.conf". Configuration file format is  
 documented in the [README](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/testutils/ptest/README) file distributed with the test script.

#### Configuration parameter for speeding up unit tests

Unit tests will run faster if the Hive configuration parameter  
[hive.exec.submit.local.task.via.child]({{< ref "#hive-exec-submit-local-task-via-child" >}}) is set to true. See [HIVE-7271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7271) for details.

## Usage

You can see all possible options by running:

```
hive_repo/testutils/ptest/hivetest.py --help

```

### Testing a Differential revision

If you want to test a patch from [Phabricator](https://reviews.facebook.net), you  
 can use this command:

```
hive_repo/testutils/ptest/hivetest.py --test --revision D123

```

### Testing a patch from file system

You can also test a patch from local file system.

```
hive_repo/testutils/ptest/hivetest.py --test --patch /path/to/my.patch

```

You can provide multiple patches if you want to. They will be applied in the  
 same order they appear on the command line.

```
hive_repo/testutils/ptest/hivetest.py --test --patch first.patch second.patch

```

### Multiple test runs

Multiple users can run parallel tests using the same configuration file without  
 problems. If you want to run different test instances simultaneously as one user you'll  
 have to export "HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX" environmental variable and set it to some  
 unique string for each instance.

The [README](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/testutils/ptest/README) file  
 distributed with the test script explains how this variable affects the paths  
 defined in your configuration file.

```
HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX=first_run hive_repo/testutils/ptest/hivetest.py --test &
HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX=second_run hive_repo/testutils/ptest/hivetest.py --test &

```

### Testing report

The paths here assume you're using "~/hivetests" as your "master_base_path"; if  
 you are using some other path, update the paths accordingly.

After the test run ends, a test report will be generated in  
 "~/hivetests/report/TIMESTAMP"; the main file is named "report.html". Since  
 JUnit properties lists take up a lot of space, by default they are generated in  
 separate ".html" files and linked from "report.html". If you want to generate  
 just one file (for easy copying for example) you can use "--one-file-report"  
 switch and the properties will be embedded in "report.html". Keep in mind that  
 instead of getting a ~300k file, you'll get one that might be more than 10MB.

If you want to use a fixed report name instead of a timestamp, you can use  
 "--report-name" switch, for example:

```
hive_repo/testuitls/ptest/hivetest.py --test --revision D123 --report-name D123

```

This will generate report in "~/hivetests/report/D123". If there was already a  
 report with that name it will be removed.

### Tests output

".q.out" files from TestCliDriver and TestNegativeCliDriver runs will be copied  
 to "~/hivetests/report/TIMESTAMP/out" so they are available in one place.

### Hive logs

"hive.log" files from all test runs will be copied to  
 "~/hivetests/report/TIMESTAMP/logs" and will be renamed to  
 "hive-HOST-TESTCASE.log".

## Possible issues

Minimr tests (TestMinimrCliDriver, TestNegativeMinimrCliDriver and  
 TestHBaseMinimrCliDriver) can't run simultaneously on one machine. The script  
 makes sure they are not scheduled to run simultaneously on the same host during  
 one test run, but multiple script runs (multiple users or one user testing  
 multiple patches at the same time) might collide and cause failures in that test  
 cases.
