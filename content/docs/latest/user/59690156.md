# Apache Hive : Hive HPL/SQL

Hive Hybrid Procedural SQL On Hadoop (HPL/SQL) is a tool that implements procedural SQL for Hive. It is available in Hive 2.0.0 ([HIVE-11055](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11055)).

*HPL/SQL is an open source tool (Apache License 2.0) that implements procedural SQL language for Apache Hive, SparkSQL, Impala as well as any other SQL-on-Hadoop implementation, any NoSQL and any RDBMS.*

*HPL/SQL is a hybrid and heterogeneous language that understands syntaxes and semantics of almost any existing procedural SQL dialect, and you can use with any database, for example, running existing Oracle PL/SQL code on Apache Hive and Microsoft SQL Server, or running Transact-SQL on Oracle, Cloudera Impala or Amazon Redshift.*

*HPL/SQL language is compatible to a large extent with Oracle PL/SQL, ANSI/ISO SQL/PSM (IBM DB2, MySQL, Teradata i.e), PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL (Netezza), Transact-SQL (Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase) that allows you leveraging existing SQL/DWH skills and familiar approach to implement data warehouse solutions on Hadoop. It also facilitates migration of existing business logic to Hadoop.*

*HPL/SQL is an efficient way to implement ETL processes in Hadoop.*

HPL/SQL language is compatible to a large extent with Oracle PL/SQL, ANSI/ISO SQL/PSM (IBM DB2, MySQL, Teradata), PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL, Netezza) and Transact-SQL (Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase) that facilitates migration of existing business logic to Hadoop.

See [HPL/SQL Reference](http://www.hplsql.org/doc) for documentation.
