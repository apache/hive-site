# Apache Hive : Apache Hive SQL Conformance

This page documents which parts of the SQL standard are supported by Apache Hive. The information here is not a full statement of conformance but provides users detail sufficient to generally understand Hive's SQL conformance.

This information is versioned by Hive release version, allowing a user to quickly identify features available to them.

The formal name of the current SQL standard is ISO/IEC 9075 "Database Language SQL". A revised version of the standard is released from time to time; the most recent update appearing in 2016. The 2016 version is referred to as ISO/IEC 9075:2016, or simply as SQL:2016. Hive's SQL Conformance pages reference SQL features by the Feature ID values of the SQL:2016 Standard.
