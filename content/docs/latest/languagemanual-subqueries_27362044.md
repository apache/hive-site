# Apache Hive : LanguageManual SubQueries

* [Subqueries in the FROM Clause]({{< ref "#subqueries-in-the-from-clause" >}})
* [Subqueries in the WHERE Clause]({{< ref "#subqueries-in-the-where-clause" >}})

# Subqueries in the FROM Clause

```
SELECT ... FROM (subquery) name ...
SELECT ... FROM (subquery) AS name ...   (Note: Only valid starting with Hive 0.13.0)
```

Hive supports subqueries only in the FROM clause (through Hive 0.12). The subquery has to be given a name because every table in a FROM clause must have a name. Columns in the subquery select list must have unique names. The columns in the subquery select list are available in the outer query just like columns of a table. The subquery can also be a query expression with UNION. Hive supports arbitrary levels of subqueries.

The optional keyword "AS" can be included before the subquery name in Hive 0.13.0 and later versions ([HIVE-6519](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6519)).

Example with simple subquery:

```
SELECT col 
FROM (
  SELECT a+b AS col
  FROM t1
) t2

```

Example with subquery containing a UNION ALL:

```
SELECT t3.col
FROM (
  SELECT a+b AS col
  FROM t1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT c+d AS col
  FROM t2
) t3

```

# Subqueries in the WHERE Clause

As of [Hive 0.13](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-784) some types of subqueries are supported in the WHERE clause. Those are queries where the result of the query can be treated as a constant for IN and NOT IN statements (called *uncorrelated subqueries* because the subquery does not reference columns from the parent query):

```
SELECT *
FROM A
WHERE A.a IN (SELECT foo FROM B);

```

The other supported types are EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries:

```
SELECT A
FROM T1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT B FROM T2 WHERE T1.X = T2.Y)

```

There are a few limitations:

* These subqueries are only supported on the right-hand side of an expression.
* IN/NOT IN subqueries may only select a single column.
* EXISTS/NOT EXISTS must have one or more correlated predicates.
* References to the parent query are only supported in the WHERE clause of the subquery.
