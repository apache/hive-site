The Binary type proposed by Ashutosh Chauhan, HIVE-2380 was discussed. There was agreement that a design document is needed to explain the proposed changes for this feature. The design document should cover:
Can columns of binary type be used as a key in group by or join? What native functions exist to manipulate binary types? How does casting between binary and other types work?</description></item><item><title>Apache Hive : ContributorMinutes20111205</title><link>https://hive.apache.org/community/meetings/contributorminutes20111205/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hive.apache.org/community/meetings/contributorminutes20111205/</guid><description>Apache Hive : ContributorMinutes20111205 Notes from the Hive Meetup at Facebook, 12/5/11

The 0.7 release is out, and Carl proposed an 0.7.1 release for items such as PostgreSQL metastore upgrade scripts and Maven artifact publication.

Everyone was fine with this; Carl will manage the release.</description></item><item><title>Apache Hive : HiveContributorsMinutes100601</title><link>https://hive.apache.org/community/meetings/hivecontributorsminutes100601/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hive.apache.org/community/meetings/hivecontributorsminutes100601/</guid><description>Apache Hive : HiveContributorsMinutes100601 Notes provided by Namit Jain.
